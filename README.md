Leet Code Algorithm Practice
=================

This is where I keep all of the algorithms I have completed on leet-code. I've included an overview and brief description of each solution.

Why? 
===

Lately, I have been getting my butt kicked in technical interviews; which is because I don't practice enough.  
This repository is a one-stop review shop where I can develop a more intimate understanding of algorithms and data structures in general.

Questions & Suggestions
===

Please reach out! I learn a lot better when interacting with others, regardless of if I am the one teaching/being taught.   
You probably do too!
